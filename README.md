Welcome to the Flask-JWT-Authentication project! This application offers an easy way for you to manage user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). You can securely log users in and allow them to sign up for your service without much hassle.

## üî• Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Keep user information safe with strong authentication methods.
- **User Registration**: Allow new users to easily sign up for your service.
- **Token-Based Access**: Use JWT to manage user sessions securely.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup to help you get started quickly.

### üñ• System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM minimum
- **Storage**: 100 MB of available space
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher

## üîß How to Use

### 1. Download the Application

Go to the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/SS240103299/Flask-JWT-Authentication/releases) and download the latest version of the application. Look for the file ending in `.zip`.

### 2. Extract the Files

Once you download the `.zip` file, locate it in your downloads folder. Right-click the file and choose ‚ÄúExtract All.‚Äù This will create a new folder with the application files inside.

### 3. Install Dependencies

If you have not already, you need to install Python. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After installing Python, open your command prompt or terminal. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the application files. You can do this by typing the command:

```bash
cd path\to\the\folder
```

Then, install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

You can now run the application. In the terminal, type:

```bash
python app.py
```

This command will start the server. 

### 5. Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You will see the application interface.

## üìù How It Works

This application uses JWT for secure user authentication. When a user logs in, the application generates a token. This token is then sent back to the user. The user needs to send this token whenever they access secured parts of the application.

1. **Sign Up**: Users fill out a registration form.
2. **Log In**: Users enter their credentials.
3. **Token Generation**: Upon successful login, a JWT is created and returned to the user.
4. **Session Management**: The user can access their account using the JWT.

## üöß Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

- **Cannot Connect to Server**: Ensure you have run the command `python app.py` in your terminal.
- **User Registration Not Working**: Check if you have the correct database setup.
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install Python and other required libraries.
